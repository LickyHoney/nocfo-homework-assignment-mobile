# NOCFO Homework Assignment - Plant Photo App ðŸŒ±

> [!NOTE]
> We recommend spending **no more than 6 hours** on this task. Focus on the essentials â€“ a functional and clear implementation is more important than perfection.

## Objective

Your task is to design and implement a mobile application that allows users to save photos of plants. The app should display a list of the plants, including their names and the dates they were added. More details are provided below. The goal is to assess your technical skills, your ability to design a well-structured application architecture, and your user interface design skills. The app should be clear, maintainable, and modern.

## App Features

The app consists of two mandatory views and one optional view:

1. **List View** *(mandatory)*  
   - The default view where users can see all added plants in a list.  
   - Each list item displays the plant's name and the date it was added.  
   - Includes a button to add a new plant, navigating to the Scan View.  

2. **Scan View** *(mandatory)*  
   - Allows users to add a new plant by taking a photo with the camera, providing a name, and optionally adding notes.  
   - Once saved, the plant appears in the List View.  

3. **Detail View** *(optional)*  
   - Users can view and edit the plant's details, such as its name, photo, and notes.

## Navigation

The app should implement a bottom navigation bar with three tabs:
- **List**: View for browsing and adding plants.  
- **Settings** *(empty)*: A simple navigable view with placeholder content.  
- **Profile** *(empty)*: A simple navigable view with placeholder content.  

This navigation structure allows you to demonstrate how you organize app components.

## Technical Requirements

- The app can be implemented using **React Native** or **Flutter**.  
- **State Management**: Use a simple and scalable solution like React Context, Redux, or Flutter's Provider.  
- **Data Storage**: Temporary storage is sufficient, and data can reset when the app restarts.  
- **User Interface**: Design a clear and modern UI. Implementing dark and light themes is optional.

## Submission

Submit your completed app by providing a link to a **public GitHub repository**. The repository must include:

1. **Source code**: All files necessary to run the app.  
2. **README.md file**, containing:  
   - Instructions to run the app.  
   - A brief description of the architecture and technical decisions.  

3. Screenshots of:  
   - The List View.  
   - The Scan View.  
   - The bottom navigation bar.  

Email the link to the repository to **juho.enala@nocfo.io**.
